  Using Bootstrap only, include a modal into the index.html document.
    - The button to trigger it should be nested into the navbar.
    - Change the default color of the button to have a yellow design
    - Futher challenge, inject a form or table within the modal.
      - The information within the table could be hard-coded for this challenge.
